# AccuKnox API Assignment

This project is my solution for the **AccuKnox technical assignment**, where I implemented REST APIs by analyzing the given problem statement and designing endpoints to fetch, process, and return data using external APIs.

The focus of this assignment is **correct API usage, clean logic, and clear response handling**, rather than UI or deployment complexity.

## 📌 Problem Overview

The assignment required:
- Consuming data from an external API
- Processing and filtering the response
- Exposing the processed data through custom REST APIs
- Returning structured JSON responses
- Handling errors and edge cases properly

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **FastAPI** (for building REST APIs)
- **Requests** library (for calling external APIs)
- **Uvicorn** (for running the server)
